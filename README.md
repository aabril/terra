> Nuxt + Express with an API and Statics

```
Basic app that combines [NuxtJS](nuxtjs.org) and [Express 4](expressjs.com)
aimed to serve statics endpoints combined with the parent main nuxtjs app. 

This app does not implements any database neither write/update actions since
it's goal it's to keep it simple, and being able to build it's SPA version.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

## Backpack

We use [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
